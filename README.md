A meteor web app to empower hesitant Singaporeans to pick up coding by providing them with a comprehensive directory of programming Tutors (Code Shifus) that they can consult.

Comprises:
1. **A directory of Code Shifus**: search by name or programming language/ skill
2. **Customizeable Shifu Profiles**: each tutor has a customizeable tutor profile where they list their programming expertise, suggested rates, and a brief 'About Me'

## Project Approach
1. Storing and retrieving user account information from MongoDB database
1. Allow user logins via Github and Google and local accounts
1. Building a meteor app to search and filter through tutor publication
1. Crafting an exceptional user experience with visually arresting images and smooth transitions with Materialize UI Library

## Fun To Do's
1. Try creating a tutor profile. Notice how we automatically include an image representing your programming language on your skill cards?
2. Try searching for tutors. Notice how instant it is? Because we're using a simple Regex search, we're also able to highlight the exact text within the tutor card that matches your search query.
